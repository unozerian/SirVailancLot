A QT based UI to monitor all your cameras connected to RaspberryPi

# Why
We all love good opensource projects.
and RaspberryPi is so amazing that with one main SBC you can run many things

Such as PiHole, Some UI for weather (Wink Wink I'll try to make one), Or in this case a survallance system.

# Idea
The Device is powerful enough to run as a controller for many devices like your CCTVs or Thermostat or anything that you can link up to a pi.

# The Devices integrated
